My Flexbox notes:

1. Intro

    - Adding INLINE to -flex will wrap the flex container just around the content it needs, not the whole width of the page
    - All children of flex container become flex items automatically
    - vh extension: viewport height, so 100vh is 100% of the viewport height; kind of like height: 100%
